Himachal Pradesh University Roll No Cut List Organizer Macro for MS Excel

Why This Macro:

Our University has created an online Examination System, but there is a problem. Cutlist that is generated by system (as pdf) has Rollno but they are not in well defined tables. This makes Filtering and arranging data very difficult. Also it is worth mentioning that this data can well span over 10,000 lines.
This macro some what manages to automate the process of arranging cells using some pretty straight guessworks.
